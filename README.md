# House-Sales-Analysis

In this project,  I determine the market price of a house given a set of features. I analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.

The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.
